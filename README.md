# Patient Readmission Prediction & Risk Assessment

## Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit web application designed to analyze hospital patient data and predict the risk of a patient being readmitted within 30 days of discharge. It provides both a descriptive dashboard for data exploration and an interactive tool for predicting an individual patient's readmission risk. The application helps hospital administrators and medical staff identify key factors contributing to readmissions and make data-driven decisions to improve patient outcomes.

## Features
* **Descriptive Analysis Dashboard:**
    * Interactive charts and graphs visualizing readmission rates by age group and medical specialty.
    * Top-level metrics including total patients, readmitted patients, and the overall readmission rate.
    * Filters to explore data based on age and medical specialty.
* **Patient Risk Analysis:**
    * An interactive form to input a patient's characteristics (e.g., time in hospital, number of procedures, medical specialty).
    * A predictive model that calculates and displays the patient's risk of readmission.

## Installation & Setup
To run this application, you will need to set up the Python environment and ensure all dependencies are installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnandVG742/predictive_analysis
    cd AnandVG742/predictive_analysis
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Required data and model files:**
    * Place your patient data file, `hospital_readmissions.csv`, in the project directory.
    * The predictive model and its metadata (`readmission_model.joblib` and `model_metadata.joblib`) must be generated by a separate training script, such as a file named `train_model.py`. The `analysis_readmin.py` script relies on these files being present in the same directory.

## Usage
To start the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the Streamlit command:
```bash
streamlit run analysis_readmin.py
